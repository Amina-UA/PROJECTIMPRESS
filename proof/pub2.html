          <h3> Ecological basis to embrace temporal assessment and spatial management of the European hake (Merluccius merluccius) in the northern Iberian Peninsula.</h3>

            <h2>  <p align="center">Abstract </p></h2> 
            <p align="justify">Spatial management of commercial resources is becoming an effective measure to be broadly
 implemented in the European Seas. However, it is currently unconnected from the population dynamics and the official assessment. Indeed, it is known that species abundance
 can be influenced by the environmental features of its own habitat and/or by biotic process
 that are spatially structured (e.g. reproduction, predation, among others). Usually, this
 variability is assumed to be implicitly in the abundance trends used as inputs of the stock
 assessment models and it is not explicitly taken into account. Within this context, in this
 study we propose a novel methodological approach for an effective implementation of spa39 tial and ecological knowledge that could help to embrace species spatial management in an
 operational way, providing a more holistic and ecosystem-based approach. As case study
 we used the European hake (Merluccius merluccius) in the northern continental shelf of the
 Iberian Peninsula. Hake data by length category collected during the scientific survey series “DEMERSALES” by the “Instituto Español de Oceanografía” (IEO) from 1992-to 2017
 were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian spatial-temporal models (H-BSTMs), considering
 as environmental variables Sea Bottom Temperature, Sea Bottom Salinity, bathymetry and
 rugosity of the seabed. H-BSTMs link spatially information on hake abundance to environmental variables to estimate and predict where (and how much of) this species is likely to
 be present in the studied area in a specific year.
 Indices of abundance obtained as outputs from H-BSTMs, performed with the innovative
 integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) methodology and software, are then used
 as inputs for the GADGET (Globally applicable Area Disaggregated General Ecosystem
 Toolbox) stock assessment model. </p>
